# SIGMA WEB DEVELOPMENT COURSE DOCS

_NOTE: This course is a video course uploaded by an Youtuber namely [CodeWithHarry](https://youtube.com/@codewithharry?si=1FO1nXnOVz4OGdGK) on Youtube for free. So all credits goes to him, I just studied from this course and documented it. Remember this documentation did not cover each and every basic topic but has much to get you start. And this is not completed yet and will be updated soon._

## Points To Remember Before Starting

- __Open The reference.txt File To Get Start.__

- __Every Folder Covers A Different Topic Listed In The reference.txt File.__
